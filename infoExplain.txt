Why Use Heuristics?
1.Data Characteristics: If the SMA data is relatively simple or if historical data indicates that changes are usually clear-cut and can be reasonably detected with a heuristic, it makes sense to start with this approach.
2.Resource Constraints: Heuristic methods are generally less resource-intensive and faster to implement. If you're working with limited computational resources or time constraints, a heuristic approach might be more practical.
3.Initial Analysis: Heuristic methods can serve as an initial analysis tool. Once you have more insights into the data or if the initial approach shows limitations, you can explore more sophisticated methods.
4.Interpretability: Heuristic methods are often easier to interpret and explain to stakeholders compared to complex models, making them a good choice for initial analyses and presentations.
In summary, the heuristic approach used in the code is a practical, straightforward method for detecting maneuvers in SMA data. Depending on the results and the specific requirements of your analysis, you may choose to explore more advanced methods if needed.  

Difference between two codes 

**sma1

1.Threshold Calculation:
   - Uses a fixed threshold (mean + 3 standard deviations).

2.Flexibility:
   - Static and less adaptable to different datasets.

3.Complexity:
   - Simpler to implement.

4.Optimization:
   - Fixed threshold may not be optimal for all scenarios.

**sma2

1.Threshold Calculation:
   - Uses a grid search to determine the optimal threshold by evaluating various values.

2.Flexibility:
   - More adaptable, adjusts dynamically to the dataset.

3.Complexity:
   - More complex due to grid search and function for maneuver detection.

4.Optimization:
   - Aims to find the best threshold, potentially improving accuracy.
