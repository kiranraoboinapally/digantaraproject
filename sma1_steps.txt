### Code Overview with Explanation

The code is designed to detect significant changes (maneuvers) in the Semi-Major Axis (SMA) data, which can be an indicator of orbital maneuvers in space missions. It does this by analyzing changes in SMA values and visualizing the results.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - `pandas` is used for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `numpy` is used for numerical operations.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` is used for plotting data.

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   ```python
   file_path = 'SMA_data.csv'
   sma_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
   ```
   The dataset `SMA_data.csv` is loaded into a DataFrame `sma_data`.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   ```python
   sma_data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(sma_data['Datetime'])
   ```
   The `Datetime` column is converted from a string to a `datetime` object to enable time-based operations.

4. **Extract Date:**
   ```python
   sma_data['Date'] = sma_data['Datetime'].dt.date
   ```
   A new column `Date` is created by extracting the date part from the `Datetime` column. This helps in focusing on the date without the time component.

5. **Reorder Columns:**
   ```python
   sma_data = sma_data[['Date', 'SMA']]
   ```
   The DataFrame is reordered to place the `Date` column before the `SMA` column for easier readability.

6. **Calculate Rate of Change:**
   ```python
   sma_data['SMA_diff'] = sma_data['SMA'].diff()
   ```
   The difference between consecutive `SMA` values is calculated to determine the rate of change.

7. **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation:**
   ```python
   mean_sma_diff = sma_data['SMA_diff'].mean()
   std_sma_diff = sma_data['SMA_diff'].std()
   ```
   The mean and standard deviation of these differences are computed to understand the typical variation.

8. **Set Detection Threshold:**
   ```python
   threshold = mean_sma_diff + (std_sma_diff * 3)
   ```
   A threshold is set as the mean difference plus three times the standard deviation. This helps in identifying significant deviations from the norm.

9. **Detect Maneuvers:**
   ```python
   sma_data['Maneuver'] = np.abs(sma_data['SMA_diff']) > threshold
   ```
   A maneuver is detected if the absolute value of the SMA difference exceeds the threshold.

10. **Extract Detected Maneuvers:**
    ```python
    maneuver_data = sma_data[sma_data['Maneuver']]
    ```
    The rows where maneuvers were detected are extracted into a new DataFrame `maneuver_data`.

11. **Display Detected Maneuvers:**
    ```python
    maneuver_table = maneuver_data[['Date', 'SMA']]
    print("Detected Maneuvers:")
    print(maneuver_table)
    ```
    The detected maneuvers are displayed, showing the date and corresponding SMA values.

12. **Plot the Data:**
    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(sma_data['Date'], sma_data['SMA'], label='SMA', color='blue', linewidth=1)
    plt.scatter(maneuver_data['Date'], maneuver_data['SMA'], color='red', label='Detected Maneuver', marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('SMA')
    plt.title('SMA with Detected Maneuvers')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    ```
    - A line plot of the SMA values over time is created.
    - Detected maneuvers are highlighted with red markers.
    - Labels, title, and legend are added to make the plot informative.
    - The x-axis labels are rotated for better readability.

This code provides a comprehensive way to analyze and visualize significant changes in SMA data, which can be critical for understanding orbital maneuvers.
